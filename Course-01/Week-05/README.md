## 01. Grade Classification Lab

Write a program that inputs two grades separated by a space.  

- If both grades are below a score of sixty then the program should output the message:

    - Student Failed:(

- If both grades are greater than or equal to ninety five then the program should output the message:

    - Student Graduated with Honors:)

- Otherwise the program should output the message:

    - Student Graduated!

- Evaluating Test 3 Output (2.0/2.0)

- Evaluating Test 4 Output (2.0/2.0)

- Evaluating Test 5 Output (2.0/2.0)

## 02. Counting Even and Odd Number Lab

Write a program that inputs four numbers separated by spaces.  The program should count how many odd and even numbers there are. The program should then output one of three possibilities depending on how many even and odd numbers are entered:

1. more evens
2. more odds
3. same number of evens and odds

For example, an execution could look like this:

```console
ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-248:~$ g++ countoddeven.cpp && ./a.out
Please enter 4 positive integers, separated by a space: 2 3 5 7
more odds
```

- Evaluating Test 2 Output (2.0/2.0)

- Evaluating Test 3 Output (2.0/2.0)

- Evaluating Test 4 Output (2.0/2.0)

- Evaluating Test 5 Output (2.0/2.0)

## 03. Leap Year Command Line Lab

Write a program for determining if a year is a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar
system you can check if it is a leaper if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.

For example, 1896, 1904, and 2000 were leap years but 1900 was not.

Write a program that takes in a year as input (as a command line argument) and returns the string "{year} was a leap year'' if true and "{year} was not a leap year'' if false.

#### Autograder Results

- Evaluating 1900 (2.0/2.0)
- Evaluating 2000 Test (2.0/2.0)
- Evaluating 2004 Test (2.0/2.0)
- Evaluating 2012 Test (2.0/2.0)
- Evaluating 2018 Test (2.0/2.0)
